A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code.



## Purpose

A "Hello, World!" program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language.

"Hello, World!" is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.

`main( ) {`
`printf("hello, world\n");`
`}`
